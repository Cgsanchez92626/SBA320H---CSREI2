# SBA 320H - React Web Application Project

# The MVP:

# 1. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, REACT, and Redux Toolkit.

# 2. Render.com

# 3. Frequent commits to GitHub.

# 4. A README.md file in your GitHub repository with:

# Explanations of the technologies used.

# o Using React learned standard of project organization to help with code

# maintainability/readability

# o Used design principles of organization and look/feel to appeal to the # end-user

# o Using Redux to manage the state of authentication in Login as certain # areas of the site require login and we have the need to persist the # state of authentication thoughout the website.

# o Using React-Redux - Dispatch within Login to manage navigation also # within the Navbar to display changes to Menu Items based on Login # status and keep it consistent across the site

# o Using React-Redux useState, useEffect in Listings page - to allow the # form to displayed without the carousel components, only revealing the # carousel components once the form is completed.

# o Using React-Redux toolkit - in authSlice to manage the login state

# Also in PropertySlice using createSlice, createAsyncThunk and axios

# to manage API call for property listing

# o A link to your live site.

# o Usage instructions, use the following credentials to authenticate

# and see restricted pages on the site:

# email: "User1@CSREI.com", password: "pw123"

# or email: "User2@CSREI.com", password: "pw123"

# 5. Use axios library that simplifies AJAX requests and handles promises.

# to make a request to an external data source (Zillow property search API

# (via RapidAPI)), Rather than directly manipulating the DOM, the data

# fetched from the API is managed by Redux. Components connected to the

# Redux store will receive this data and render it appropriately.
